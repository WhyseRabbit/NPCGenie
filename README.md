Pathfinder NPC Generator

Using [this site](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1040) as guideline for building NPCs.

Data broken into different components
First names will be broken into three parts and sorted by region and race to maximize name randomness; surnames will be broken into two parts along the same principles.

Ancestry will be given base HP, size (usually Medium or Small), speed, ability boosts (2 += stat), ability flaw (2 -= stat), languages, traits, special features, heritage, heritage feature.

Job/class provides skills and 5 ability boosts (max ability score of 16 or +3 for now). Key ability score will be identified and be max number.

NPCs can be divided into common and adventuring categories. If common, equipment and money will be scarce. If NPC is adventurer, money count will be higher; equipment will be random.

First path to tackle: ancestry and heritage.
